# Web-Gen-Viz
Generate charts on the go, run the server and connect for simple chart construction.
See the [Unity client](https://github.com/tiagodavi70/Web-Gen-Viz/tree/master/unity-client) and the [web service](https://github.com/tiagodavi70/Web-Gen-Viz/tree/master/chart-generation-service/) for instructions on instalation and usage.


# TODO
* Put some images of it working, a big one at the beginning for overview and some others for example
* Needs the architecture image
* step by step video on clean machine

# Contributions
All servers modifications (unless it is a bug correction) must update the corresponding README, right now it's the most trustable specification outside the code.
