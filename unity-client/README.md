# Unity Client

Client for chart generation web service. It renders a chart image after a query.

## Usage

Import the _.unitypackage_ of this directory in your project. The _Vis_ prefab has the `ChartGenerator` C# Script associated as an example. This script does the requests and generates the sprites on the game object. The prefab shows the usage and the script generates a chart on start of execution and can be updated. **`NodeJS` server must be running for this package to work**. For instructions about the server and its settings, refer to [this page](https://github.com/tiagodavi70/Web-Gen-Viz/tree/master/chart-generation-service/).
