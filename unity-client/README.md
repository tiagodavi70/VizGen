# Unity Client

Client for chart generation web service. It renders an chart image after a query.

## Usage
Import the _.unitypackage_ of this directory in your project. The _Vis_ prefab has the _ChartGenerator_ C# Script associated as an example. This script does the requests and generates the sprites on the game object. The prefab shows the usage and the script generates a chart on start of execution and can be updated.
